# Automation-Ideas-Feature-Requests
This repository will be used exclusively to receive and manage suggestions from the public on how to better automate the ingest, publication and downstream 
usage of CVE Records and other CVE Program published information.   It is not meant as a "bug reporting" mechanism of the existing CVE Services/Web site.  
Reporting "bugs" of existing CVE Program automation components (e.g, CVE Services, Bulk Download, JSON 5.0 schema definition) should be posted on the "issues"  boards associated with the specific application reqpository under the CVE Program Github Project.
