# Automation-Ideas-Feature-Requests
This repository will be used exclusively to receive and manage suggestions from the public on how to better automate the ingest, publication and downstream 
usage of CVE Records and other CVE Program published information.   It is not meant as a "bug reporting" mechanism of the existing CVE Services/Web site. For reporting specific issues with existing services and functions, please post those observations to the "Issues" tab of those projects but a place where new features can be requested, reviewed and managed in a transparent manner.  Bugs of existing utomation components (e.g, CVE Services, Bulk Download, JSON 5.0 schema definition) should be posted on their respective issues boards under the CVE Program Github Project.
