# CVE Program Innovative Ideas and New Feature Requests
This repository will be used exclusively to receive and manage suggestions from the public focused on how to enhance the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/) to better serve the broader community.  

“Innovative ideas” and “new feature requests” can include programmatic rule/policy suggestions as well as innovative automation features that would support more efficient CVE Record publication and use.

Note that this is not meant as a bug reporting mechanism for the existing CVE Services, CVE Website, or other fielded components (e.g., CVE Services, Bulk Download, CVE JSON 5.0 schema definition). Reporting of bugs for existing CVE Program automation components should be done on the “Issues” boards associated with the appropriate application repository under the [CVE Program GitHub Project](https://github.com/CVEProject).
