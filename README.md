# CVE Program Automation-Ideas-Feature-Requests
This repository will be used exclusively to receive and manage suggestions from the public focused on how to better automate the ingest, publication and downstream usage of CVE Records and other CVE Program published information.   It is not meant as a "bug reporting" mechanism of the existing CVE Services/Web site or other fielded components (e.g, CVE Services, Bulk Download, JSON 5.0 schema definition).  Reporting "bugs" of existing CVE Program automation components should be posted on the "issues"  boards associated with the appropriate application reqpository under the CVE Program Github Project.

# Submitting a CVE Program New Feature Request
To submit a New Feature/Capability Request, use the "Issues" board tab for this repository (ie., Automation-Ideas-Feature-Request) in the upper left of the page.  Fill out the Issues Template with a short description of the suggested feature.  Note that the description should include a rationale statement that includes the overall benefit to the program and  what audience will benefit from the feature (e.g., CNAs, down stream users of CVE data, general public)   Feel free to add further notes/suggestions that may help with the prioritization/design, and implementation discussion in the "Notes" section. 

# Processing of a CVE Program New Feature Request
Once the Requested Feature is submitted, it will be reviewed by the CVE Board (or its designated working group).  The disposition of the Feature request can be tracked on the [Automation Upgrade Feature Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/CVEProject/projects/14/views/1)  Questions about the new feature can be directed via email to the [CVE Program Automation Working Group](mailto:AWG@cve-cwe-programs.groups.io)
