# CVE Program Innovative Ideas and New Feature Requests
This repository will be used exclusively to receive and manage suggestions from the public focused on how to enhance the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/) to better serve the broader community.  

Innovative ideas and requested features can include programmatic rule/policy suggestions as well as innovative automation features that would support more efficient CVE Record publication and use.

Note that this is not meant as a “bug reporting” mechanism of the existing CVE Services, CVE Website, or other fielded components (e.g., CVE Services, Bulk Download, CVE JSON 5.0 schema definition). Reporting bugs of existing CVE Program automation components should be posted on the “Issues” boards associated with the appropriate application repository under the [CVE Program GitHub Project](https://github.com/CVEProject).

# Submitting a CVE Program Innovative Idea or New Feature Request
To submit an innovative idea/feature request, follow these steps:   
   
1. Use the “Issues” board tab for this CVE-Program-Innovation-Ideas-and-Feature-Requests repository located in the upper left of the page.  
2. Fill-out the “Issues Template” with a short description of the suggested feature. The description should include a rationale statement that includes the overall benefit to the program and which audience will benefit from the innovative idea or new feature (e.g., CNAs, downstream users of CVE data, general public).     
3. Add additional notes or suggestions that may help with the prioritization, design, and/or implementation in the “Notes” section (optional).  

# Processing of a CVE Program Innovative Idea or New Feature Request
Once the innovative idea or new feature is submitted, it will be reviewed by the [CVE Board](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/Board) (or its designated working group). The disposition of the innovative idea or new feature request can be tracked on the [CVE Program Innovative Ideas/Feature Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/CVEProject/projects/14/views/1). Questions about the innovative ideas or new features can be directed via email to the [CVE Program Automation Working Group](mailto:AWG@cve-cwe-programs.groups.io).
